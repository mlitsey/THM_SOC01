In this challenge room, we will take a simple challenge to investigate an alert by IDS regarding a potential C2 communication.

## _**2: Scenario - Investigate a potential C2 communication alert**_

**Scenario**

During normal SOC monitoring, Analyst John observed an alert on an IDS solution indicating a potential C2 communication from a user Browne from the HR department. A suspicious file was accessed containing a malicious pattern THM:{ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ }. A week-long HTTP connection logs have been pulled to investigate. Due to limited resources, only the connection logs could be pulled out and are ingested into the `connection_logs` index in Kibana.
