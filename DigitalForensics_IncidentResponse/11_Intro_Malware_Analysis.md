# 1: Introduction

Every once in a while, when you are working as a SOC analyst, you will come across content (a file or traffic) that seems suspicious, and you will have to decide whether that content is malicious or not. It is normal to feel confused with all the mixed signals that such content provides. This becomes a little overwhelming for somebody who is just starting in Cybersecurity, and it is common to begin self-guessing oneself. Knowing what steps to take to resolve such a scenario is helpful. This room will lay down some steps to help you make the initial conclusion about a particular suspicious file.

Notably, in this room, you will learn:

- What is malware?
- How to start analyzing a malware
- Static and Dynamic malware analysis
- Resources to help you analyze malware

So let's get started!




# 2: Malware Analysis

## Malware

The word malware is derived from the term MALicious softWARE. Therefore, any software that has a malicious purpose can be considered malware. Malware is further classified into different categories based on its behavior. However, we will not go into the details of those in this room. Here we will ponder the steps we will take if we suspect that we found malware in a machine. So, let's get started.

## The purpose behind Malware Analysis

Malware Analysis is an important skill to have. As a quick overview, Malware Analysis is performed by the following people in the Security Industry:

- **Security Operations** teams analyze malware to write detections for malicious activity in their networks.
- **Incident Response** teams analyze malware to determine what damage has been done to an environment to remediate and revert that damage.
- **Threat Hunt** teams analyze malware to identify IOCs, which they use to hunt for malware in a network.
- **Malware Researchers** in security product vendor teams analyze malware to add detections for them in their security products.
- **Threat Research** teams in OS Vendors like Microsoft and Google analyze malware to discover the vulnerabilities exploited and add more security features to the OS/applications.

Overall, it seems like many different people do malware Analysis for many compelling reasons. So let's see how to start!

## Before we begin!

Please note that malware is like a weapon because it can produce great harm if not handled with care. For this reason, always take the following precautions while analyzing malware:

- Never analyze malware or suspected malware on a machine that does not have the sole purpose of analyzing malware.
- When not analyzing or moving malware samples around to different locations, always keep them in password-protected zip/rar or other archives so that we can avoid accidental detonation.
- Only extract the malware from this password-protected archive inside the isolated environment, and only when analyzing it.
- Create an isolated VM specifically for malware analysis, which has the capability of being reverted to a clean slate once you are done.
- Ensure that all internet connections are closed or at least monitored.
- Once you are done with malware analysis, revert the VM to its clean slate for the next malware analysis session to avoid residue from a previous malware execution corrupting the next one.
